As for the side panels, boxplots of the diamonds’ cut compared to the carat size are on the top (x panel), and diamonds’ cut and price are compared on the right (y panel).\r\nStudent’s Heights Compared with their Class Year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the StudentSurvey data set from the Lock5Data package, this visualization compares students’ heights based on their grade level with layered density plots. The variables ‘Height’ and ‘Year’ are used.\r\nGGCorrplot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the ggcorrplot package, this visualization creates a correlation matrix into a visualization comparing a few variables (carat, price, table,lengths(x,y,z), and depth) of the ‘diamonds’ data set. The visualization shows positive and negative correlations between these variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "For this exhibit, I used the \"Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023\" dataset on Kaggle. This dataset includes the most famous songs on spotify as of 2023. It provides each songs' track name, artists, release date (in day, month, and year), where the song is in Spotify, Apple, Deezer, and Shazam charts, the bpm, key, and mode of the song, and percentages based on the song's danceability, valence, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, and speechiness. \n",

It is observed that songs in the top of Spotify’s charts aren’t necessarily also in the top of Apple’s charts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpotify versus Apple Playlists\r\nThis scatter plot provides a comparison between the number of Spotify and number of Apple playlists a song is in. While the number of playlists the song is included is relatively equal when on the lower end, some bigger hits in Spotify playlists aren’t in nearly as many Apple playlists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtists with Most Chart Appearances\r\nThis interactive plotly displays the number of appearances the top ten artists have had in the Spotify charts of 2023. This visualization required a cut version of the “artist.s._name” variable, and a created variable of the number of appearances each of those artists had. It is observed that Taylor Swift had the most appearances on the chart with 34 appearances, The Weeknd in second place with 22, and SZA and Bad Bunny tied for the third most appearances at 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtist Count and Streams\r\nHere, a discrete scatter plot compares the number of artists on a song with how many streams a song receives, using the ‘artist_count’ and ‘streams’ variables. The plot shows that more artists on a song may correlate to the song getting less streams. However, there are significantly less observations with more than two artists, so a definitive conclusion cannot be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSongs’ Energy Rating and Release Month\r\nUsing the released_month and energy_. variables, this discrete scatter plot shows the relationship between songs’ energy ratings and the month of the year they were released. Songs released in the summer months tend to have higher energy ratings than those in late winter months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSongs’ Energy versus Acousticness\r\nUsing the ‘energy_’. and ‘acousticness_.’ variables, I created a scatter plot displaying a moderate negative correlation between songs’ energy and acousticness percentages. There appears to be no statistically significant difference between songs that are written in mode major versus minor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSongs’ Keys versus their Instrumentalness\r\nUsing the ‘key’ and ‘instrumentalness_.’ variables, I compared each song’s key to its instrumentalness percentage using the lemon package. Here we can observe that the D#, F, and G keys have songs with the highest instrumentalness percentages, yet most observations are below 25% intstrumentalness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSongs’ Keys versus Release Month\r\nThis density graph visualization compares release month to different keys of songs using the ‘key’ and ‘release_month’ variables. It is observed that each key is released more frequently at different times of year. For example, songs in the key of D are released less during the months from May-July, however songs in the key of D# and B are released most during this time period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSongs’ BPM and Danceability\r\nUsing the ‘bpm’ and ‘danceability_.’ variables, this scatter plot displays the moderate relationship between a song’s bpm and danceability rating, which gives a parabola shape. As bpm increases, the danceability of the song will tend to increase up to a certain point, then at higher bpms, the danceability decreases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat makes a Top Song?\r\nHere, the two most popular artists, Taylor Swift and The Weeknd’s songs are compared based on their energy and valence percentage ratings. This comparison shows that a top song is not determined soley on its energy, since Swift’s energy ratings are broad, but it does not depend on valence either for the same reason. Overall, many factors go into what makes a top song in the charts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
